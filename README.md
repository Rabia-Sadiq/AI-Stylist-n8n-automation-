# 👗  Intelligent AI Wardrobe & Outfit Recommendation System

An end-to-end AI automation system that transforms a physical wardrobe into a structured, intelligent, and interactive digital styling assistant.

This project automatically analyzes clothing images, stores structured metadata, understands natural language outfit requests, selects appropriate outfits strictly from the user’s wardrobe, and generates a styled mannequin illustration.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This system solves three problems:

1. Digitizing a wardrobe automatically
2. Understanding natural language outfit requests
3. Generating realistic outfit visualizations

It combines automation, computer vision, NLP, database filtering, and image generation into one orchestrated workflow.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🧥 1. Smart Wardrobe Ingestion

* Watches a specific Google Drive folder
* Automatically detects newly uploaded clothing images
* Uses AI vision model to extract:

  * Type
  * Color
  * Formality
  * Season
  * Occasion Type
* Stores structured clothing data in Supabase

---

### 💬 2. Natural Language Outfit Requests

Users can send messages like:

* “I’m going to a cafe today”
* “Suggest something casual”
* “What should I wear to a wedding?”

The system:

* Extracts structured attributes from user intent
* Infers missing details intelligently
* Returns clean JSON
* Filters wardrobe accordingly

---

### 🧠 3. Intelligent Wardrobe Filtering

* Fetches wardrobe from Supabase
* Matches items based on:

  * Type
  * Color
  * Formality
  * Season
  * Occasion
* Supports partial and flexible matching
* Gracefully falls back if no exact match is found

---

### 👗 4. Strict AI Stylist Mode

The stylist model operates under strict constraints:

* Can ONLY select items already present in the wardrobe
* Cannot invent new clothing items
* Cannot modify attributes
* Must copy items exactly from database

This prevents hallucination and ensures realistic styling.

---

### 🎨 5. AI Outfit Illustration

* Selected clothing items are downloaded
* Sent to image editing model
* Generates a realistic full-body mannequin illustration
* Maintains accurate colors and textures
* No new accessories or items added
